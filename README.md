SkillsLah!

# Problem
Elderly people have always suffered from several detrimental ailments due to the lack of either physical exercise, mental stimulation, or a combination of both. A scary but very common disorder is dementia, something that can be caused by spending too much time watching television. 

# Solution 
Our solution is a course website that encourages the elderly to keep their minds healthy by keeping themselves occupied while also picking up new hobbies and things they can do instead of doing nothing.

# Goal of this project 
Our Goal for SkillsLah! is to have a reliable and consistent site for people to find new useful and fun skills that can enhance their lives and keep themselves stimulated, mainly focusing on the older age group of people in Singapore. 
The website will be tailor-made for elderly people that prevents the elderly from being too confused when using the website. The simple and to-the-point design will ensure that users will get to learning something new as soon as possible.
